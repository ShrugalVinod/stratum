Newest first. What was done, what's next, blockers.

## 2026-10-13 — Phase 0 (setup and guard-rails)

**Done**
- Read the build prompt, the research paper v1.0, synopsis, phase plan and Lean Canvas; listed differences between prompt and paper (resolved in `decisions.md`).
- Created the repo (`~/code/stratum`, GitHub `ShrugalVinod/stratum`, private) with the full folder structure.
- Pinned environment (Python 3.12, `uv.lock`, 159 packages incl. pycontrails 0.64.0, satpy 0.60, openap, eumdac, lightgbm, xgboost); `requirements-colab.txt` exported.
- `stratum` package core: `config.py` (strict typed configs, config hash, corridor polygon), `paths.py` (laptop/CI/Colab roots, Drive layout), `manifest.py` (run manifests, `_SUCCESS` markers, resumability), `lock.py` (pre-registration lock + deviation check), `cli.py` (`info`, `init-drive`, `write-corridor`, `lock-preregistration`, `verify-lock`).
- `configs/preregistered.yaml` populated from the paper with section citations; 15 open questions written, 11 settled, 4 open with owners.
- Tests, ruff, mypy --strict, pre-commit (detect-secrets, nbstripout), GitHub Actions CI.
- `colab/00_smoke_test.ipynb`; `docs/data_sources.md` account guide.

**Next**
- Shrugal: create the `GITHUB_TOKEN` Colab secret, run the Colab smoke test, review `preregistered.yaml` and say "approved" → lock.
- Start account requests now (OpenSky approval can take weeks): CDS, EUMETSAT, OpenSky.

**Blockers**
- Lock waits for the team's "approved" on `preregistered.yaml`.
- Colab smoke test needs Shrugal to run it.
